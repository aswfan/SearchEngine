This is a Java project with limited functions. It applies Apache Lucene(4.10) to realize a simple search engine.

It mainly contains **TWO** files:

- **Indexer:**  mainly for dealing with index creating and updating

- **Searcher:** mainly for dealing with key words query and highlighting

*!Note: Unfortunately, It has not been tested until now, so it main contains some bugs :)*
